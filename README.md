# Mxpertz-Python-Flask-Login-Referral-Service

## Project Name: User Referral System (Mxpertz Internship Assignment)

This Flask-based web application implements a user-friendly login and signup service that includes user accounts and a referral system.
Registered users are assigned unique referral codes, and new users can choose to enter a referral code from an existing user during registration.
The application uses Flask for its backend, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Flask-Login for user authentication.
Users can view a list of their referred users on the home page.
The system also generates random referral codes for new users when not provided.
A simple yet effective tool for managing user referrals.
